# Blueprint-Driven Development Process

When working on code, always consider the relevant blueprints to maintain consistency with established patterns and decisions.

## Blueprint References

Automatically include relevant blueprint files based on the work context:

@docs/project-blueprint.md
@docs/app-blueprint.md  
@docs/patterns.md

## Development Guidelines

- **Check blueprints first** before making architectural or design decisions
- **Update blueprints** when making significant changes or discovering new patterns
- **Follow established patterns** documented in patterns.md
- **Maintain consistency** with the overall project vision and user flows
- **Document new patterns** that emerge during development

## When to Reference Each Blueprint

- **Project Blueprint**: For tech stack decisions, design principles, overall vision
- **App Blueprint**: For user flows, navigation, major sections, data flow
- **Patterns**: For UI components, interactions, reusable code patterns

## Blueprint Update Process

- Update blueprints when implementing new features or patterns
- Keep blueprints living documents that reflect current state
- Document rationale for major decisions
- Maintain high-level perspective suitable for designer review
