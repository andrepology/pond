# Learning Log

2025-01-25T15:30:00Z | Project setup | Simplified 3-file blueprint structure (project, app, patterns) | Designer prefers manageable complexity, high-level approach | Guides future development with clear, simple blueprints

2025-01-25T15:35:00Z | Blueprint system | Cursor Rules auto-fetch blueprints for code files | Maintains consistency without manual effort | AI automatically references relevant blueprints when coding

2025-01-25T15:40:00Z | Patterns documentation Designer aims for simplicity, avoid unnecessary complexity | Focus on essential visual/layout patterns only

2025-01-25T16:00:00Z | Jazz framework study | Comprehensive Jazz framework reference created | LLM-optimized development handbook covers architecture, mental model, patterns, anti-patterns | Essential for avoiding naive intuitions that conflict with Jazz's opinionated approach

2025-01-25T16:15:00Z | Jazz API enhancement | Added specific API references, userRoot vs useCoValue patterns, CoValue ID management, migrations | User needed concrete API details vs theoretical concepts | Critical for practical Jazz development - covers data access patterns, ID sourcing, schema evolution

2025-01-25T16:30:00Z | Jazz documentation analysis | Corrected migration speculation, added real API examples, filled missing sections | User pointed out prescriptive vs actual API documentation | Enhanced with real Jazz APIs: _edits, CoMap.Of(), project setup, tools, authentication providers, design patterns. Identified gaps needing official docs
